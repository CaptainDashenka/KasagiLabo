## solution for the KasahiLabo challenge

Please see the _challenge_a_ and _challenge_b_ files for the first 2 challenges and the _Dockerfile_ for the 3rd challenge.

As I have a windows system I was using the Docker Desktop for testing the Dockerfile. 

From the CLI the follwoing command runs the container and generates an output file: 

    docker run kasagilabo:latest python challenge_b.py > output.csv
